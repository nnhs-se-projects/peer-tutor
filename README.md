# Peer Tutoring App

# Overview
The Peer Tutoring App is for tutors, students, and teachers. Tutors can fill out the expertise and session forms accessible through the tutor homepage, and they can view their absences and session history through the tutor attendance page by entering their ID number. Teachers can view all the tutors and their information on the tutor database table on the teacher tab. They can also view all the sessions that have occurred on the session table. On the student tab, students can view which tutors can teach a certain subject and then request a tutor as well (Does not work). The Admin side is not yet made, but the user stories for the admin are below.

# Installation 

[Toolchain Setup] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvdn-MVotuBM6wehNdPpbbOFMzmKLPxFzErH8-mkP1s/preview?tab=t.0)

[MongoDB compass 1.46.1 Stable dmg] (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) 


# How to Run it
* For running locally, search for 8082 in router.js and auth.js files and change to 8080 (8082 used for running live server)

# Expected Result
* You will be asked to log in using google and then will reach the landing homepage. The session and tutor database tables should display the data from the database if correctly connected.

# Architecture 
* The app opens to a homepage. On the homepage are links to different pages for each group of people (teachers, students, tutors, etc.). These specific pages include resources linked for each group and their necessities. On the tutor page there are links to the Session  Form, Expertise form, and Attendance Profile. For tutor leaders, there is a link to the attendance-taking page. Teachers are given links to the session and tutor database tables. Finally the students can find a tutor and request a tutoring session page. The tutor leader, teacher, and admin pages require passwords to access. 

# Database/env File
The code for the env file is in the Trello under database

# Issues
* The attendance function does not work (no database structure and the buttons don’t update the values correctly)
* Request a tutor does not send a request (Students can fill out and submit the form but after it is submitted, the form doesn’t go anywhere)
* Authentication is not limited to district 203 members (people with non-school emails can log in and view the site)
* When submitting the session form an error message pops up saying the form didn’t submit correctly despite it going into the database perfectly ok. 
* Data types in schema do not always match with JSON files. The JSON files for grade and lunchPeriod are strings in “”, but in the schema, it is type int. There may be other JSON files that run into this issue. 
* Need to remove habitsOfMind.json in server>model & entry.js
* Ensure academic support teachers are as follows (Stephanie Moore, Angel Kalat, Christy Mathews)
* Clean/organize files
